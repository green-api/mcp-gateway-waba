## Pull requests

1. Open an issue first if the change is non-trivial — it's easier to align on direction before code is written.
2. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`).
3. Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR.
4. Include tests for new behaviour. Run `make test` locally before pushing.
5. CI must be green before merge.
